                <h2>Which city?</h2>
                The city I'd love to visit is non other than the mother city Cape Town.
                Located in the Western Province of South Africa, Cape Town is often regarded as the World’s most
                beautiful city Combining the fast pace of a great urban metropolis with the immense natural beauty
                synonymous with Africa and overlooked by the great Table Mountain, whether it’s stunning wildlife or
                crazy nightlife you are after, Cape Town has it in spades.The South Africans are also well-known for
                their partying, so they will certainly be able to show me a good time if I stop by.

                    were
                    built and leased to slaves. These people were known as Cape Malays, and were brought from

                    Indonesia and the rest of Africa to work in the Cape. </p>
